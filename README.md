# Elixir Enum.reduce Conditional Logic Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using `Enum.reduce` in Elixir with conditional logic. The `bug.exs` file contains code that incorrectly handles a condition within the reduce function, resulting in an unexpected output. The `bugSolution.exs` file provides the corrected version. 

The issue highlights the importance of carefully considering all possible outcomes of conditional statements within `Enum.reduce` to ensure the function behaves as intended.

## Running the code

Simply run `elixir bug.exs` and `elixir bugSolution.exs` to observe the different behaviors.
